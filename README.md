# Chapbook, a story format for Twine 2

_by Chris Klimas_

Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays stories created in Twine in a web browser. To use it, add this URL as a story format:

`https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/0.0.1/format.js`

Chapbook is currently in **prerelease** state. It produces working stories, but its functionality is not complete and it almost certainly contains bugs.

Chapbook is released under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other arrangement.
