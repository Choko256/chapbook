# Chapbook, a story format for Twine 2

_by Chris Klimas_

Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays stories created in Twine in a web browser. To use it, add this URL as a story format:

`https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/0.1.0/format.js`

Chapbook is currently in **prerelease** state. It produces working stories, but its functionality is not complete and it almost certainly contains bugs.

Chapbook is released under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other arrangement.

    [The guide](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/guide/) is a gentle introduction to creating with Chapbook. Start here if you'd like to start creating with Chapbook.

-   ## _Cloak of Darkness_, a sample story 
    Want a quick look at the output Chapbook produces, or the way you write a code for it? Take a look at the [story](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.html) and its [Twee source code](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.txt). If you've never used Twee before, it's a compact text-only format for Twine stories. The main thing to keep in mind is that each line beginning with `::` describes a new passage.

-   ## Report a bug or suggest a feature
    Currently, bug reports and feature suggestions are limited to [Patreon backers](https://patreon.com/klembot). The usual issue tracker will open when Chapbook 1.0 is released.
