<p><em>by Chris Klimas</em></p>
<p>Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays stories created in Twine in a web browser. To use it, add this URL as a story format:</p>
<p><code>https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/0.0.2/format.js</code></p>
<p>Chapbook is currently in <strong>prerelease</strong> state. It produces working stories, but its functionality is not complete and it almost certainly contains bugs.</p>
<p>Chapbook is released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>. It can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other arrangement.</p>

<p>Want a quick look at the output Chapbook produces, or the way you write a code for it? Take a look at the <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.html">story</a> and its <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.txt">Twee source code</a>. If you&#39;ve never used Twee before, it&#39;s a compact text-only format for Twine stories. The main thing to keep in mind is that each line beginning with <code>::</code> describes a new passage.</p>
