# Introduction

This is a guide to the Chapbook story format for Twine 2.[^1] Story formats control how a story created with the Twine editor plays in a Web browser; once you select the **Play** button in Twine or publish your story to a file, whatever story format you have selected takes over.

Chapbook is designed to be easy to work with as an author and generate output that is a pleasure to read by players. It provides sensible default behaviors for your story that be customized to fit your particular needs.

This guide does not assume you have any programming knowledge; however, it doesn't hurt to know CSS or JavaScript, as it uses both technologies heavily. It's split into several chapters that will gently guide you through creating a simple story with links to a sophisticated one that has a custom look and _TBD_.

This guide does assume, however, that you're familiar with the Twine 2 editor itself. If you're new to Twine, the [Twine 2 guide](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide) is an excellent place to start. There are also numerous tutorials on the web that can be helpful.

## How to Use Chapbook

For now, Chapbook must be added to the Twine editor by hand. To do this, choose the **Formats** button from the story list page you see when you first start up Twine, then the **Add a New Format** tab at the top of the dialog that appears. Paste the following address into the field and select the **Go** button:

```
TBD
```

Once you do that, you must set the story you're working with to publish using Chapbook. Edit one of your stories, then choose **Change Story Format** from the story menu at the bottom of the editor. Choose Chapbook here. Once you do, selecting the **Play** button or publishing your story to a file will use Chapbook format.

## An Aside on Names

There's been some debate as to whether Twine produces games or merely stories: the truth is, with Twine you can make games, you can make interactive stories, and you can also make things that nobody can quite pin down. Keeping in the spirit of vexing formalists who prefer clear boundaries, this guide calls the things you'll create with Chapbook _stories_ and the people who you share them with _players_, but you shouldn't infer anything from this usage. Please make strange things with Twine and Chapbook.

[^1]: Chapbook, sadly, cannot be used with Twine 1 for now.
