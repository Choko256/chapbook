## Embedding a YouTube Video

You've heard of [YouTube][youtube], right? To embed a YouTube video, use its URL with 

```
Tell me if you've seen this one before.

{embed YouTube video: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0'}
```

{% hint style='working' %}
For now, it's not possible to have a YouTube video start when a passage displays. The player will need to begin playback.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='working' %}
Accessibility features for video will be added to a future release of Chapbook.
