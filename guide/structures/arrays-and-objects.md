# Arrays and Objects



- text adventures originally tracked what the main character carried
- it got ridiculous, so sophisticated games implemented an inventory limit
- best way to implement an inventory limit is to use an array, cumbersome to check individual variables
- Infocom implemented a weight system so that in Deadline, you can only carry a ladder around but multiple other objects at the same time
- best way to implement is through an object

do we need to talk about functions first?! kinda because objects w/o methods are difficult to handle
