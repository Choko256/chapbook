# Introducing Backstage

When you launch your story from Twine using the **Test** button in the editor toolbar, Chapbook enables its *backstage view*: a panel that sits beside your story and allows you to peek into its workings and tinker with them while you interact with it as players will. This section discusses the **History** and **Notes** tabs in the backstage view. The other tabs, **State** and **Style**, are discussed later in this guide in *TODO*.

If you would like to temporarily hide the backstage view, use the arrow button to its left, which toggles the view's visibility.

## The History Tab

As you visit passages in your story, the History tab will show them in a tabular list, with the oldest at the top and the most recent at the bottom.

Use the &#x21b3; button beside an entry in the table to rewind the story to that passage.

## The Notes Tab

This tab can be used to record notes on the passage you're currently viewing--noting misspellings, or any other thoughts you'd like to record. Unlike [comments](comments.md), these notes are stored separately from the story itself, so that if you are collaborating with other people on a story, each of you can keep separate notes. The notes you enter are saved automatically as you type.
