# Version History

## 0.0.2, 19 October 2018

-   Fixes a bug where hard restarts in stories deleted the entire local storage
    object, which could trash, among other things, the Twine story library if
    you're using the web version (yikes). Thanks to Brendan Hennessy for
    identifying this early.
