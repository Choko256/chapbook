At last, you have come upon the most fearsome foe of all time: a dragon.

[note]
This example is to demonstrate a basic RPG system--I seriously doubt that this is well-balanced.


:: Take action
You currently have {hp} hit

[if hp === 1; append]
point

[else; append]
points

[cont'd; append]
and {potions} healing

[if potions === 1; append]
potion

[else; append]
potions

[cont'd; append]
in your pack.

[cont'd]
The dragon has {dragonHp} hit

[if dragonHp === 1; append]
point.

[else; append]
points.

> [[Attack the dragon]]

[if potions > 0]
> [[Drink a healing potion]]


:: Attack the dragon
hit: random.d10 > 3
dragonHp (hit): dragonHp - (random.d10 + 5)
--

[if hit]
You hit the dragon!

[else]
You miss the dragon!

[if dragonHp <= 0]
You have slain the dragon! It feels like an oddly hollow victory.

:: Drink a healing potion
potions: potions - 1
hp: hp + random.d20 + random.d20 + 10
--

You gulp a potion nervously.

:: Dragon attacks
dragonHit: random.d10 > 6
hp (dragonHit): hp - random.d4

[if dragonHit]
The dragon hits you!

[else]
The dragon misses you!

[if hp <= 0]
You have died! Oh dear.
